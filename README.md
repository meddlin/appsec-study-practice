# AppSec Study Practice

Diagrams I've used to document and study where common AppSec vulnerabilities typically lie within 
an application architecture. This isn't meant to be 1 vuln == 1 line of code. Rather, this details 
what pieces of architecture are involved in mitigating a type of vulnerability.

**Example: SQL Injection**

While using parameterized queries is commonly referred to as the mitigation against SQL injection, 
an injection from client to database reveals multi-layer problems.

- ‚ùå Use parameterized SQL queries
- ‚úÖ Parameterized queries (ORM), server + client-side input validations

## Getting Started

This repo should be entirely Markdown files (no executable code), so you should be able to peruse
the whole thing just like a collection of docs. However, for offline (or off GitHub) viewing, there
are a few tools that can make things better.

> Note: I am slowly moving diagrams from draw.io to Mermaid docs. So, please bear with me on the 
> progress and use the applicable viewing tool.

### Optional Tools

- Markdown Mermaid support - VSCode extension: [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.markdown-mermaid](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.markdown-mermaid)
  - üßë‚Äçüíª repo: [https://github.com/mjbvz/vscode-markdown-mermaid](https://github.com/mjbvz/vscode-markdown-mermaid)
- Draw.io support - VSCode extension: [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hediet.vscode-drawio](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hediet.vscode-drawio)

## Scenarios

### OWASP Top 10

Shows possible problem areas for each of the OWASP Top 10 vulnerability categories.

### Logging Structure

Scenario: an application has a key-value store, an API layer, and a web front-end. Then we detail
other pieces of supporting architecture that could be deployed, and determine what potential 
threats may appear across this architecture.
