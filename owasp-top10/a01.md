## OWASP \# 1 - Broken Access Control

This means "_the user can access something they aren't supposed to_".

The logic for a "broken access control" will primarily take place in the API, 
but the effects of this vulnerability will show up in the interaction between
API and front-end.

## Example Architecture

A simplified model to start with.

```mermaid

    db[("`
        KV-store
        **_data_**
    `")] --> A1[API]
    A1 <--> FE-1[web front-end]
