# A05 - Security Misconfiguration

OWASP Top 10 - A05

Ref: [https://owasp.org/Top10/A05_2021-Security_Misconfiguration/](https://owasp.org/Top10/A05_2021-Security_Misconfiguration/)

## \# 5 - Security Misconfiguration

"Misconfiguration" is another broad term that covers many possible security issues.

Common Examples

- Missing appropriate security hardening across the "tech stack"
- Improperly configured permissions on cloud services
- Unnecessary features installed/enabled


## Prevention Methods

- Strive for repeatable hardening procedures
- Focus on minimal platforms without unnecessary features, components, etc.
- Tasks to periodically review security configurations
- Segmented application architecture, via: components, tenants, containerization, cloud security groups, etc.
- Security headers


### What are (web-based) security headers?

Some of the most imporant ones:
- Strict-Transport-Security (a.k.a. HSTS - HTTP Strict Transport Security)
- Content-Security-Policy
- X-Frame-Options

Ref: [https://www.invicti.com/blog/web-security/http-security-headers/](https://www.invicti.com/blog/web-security/http-security-headers/)


#### HSTS - HTTP Strict Transport Security

- MDN, Strict-Transport-Security: [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security)
- Invicti, Strict-Transport-Security: [https://www.invicti.com/learn/http-strict-transport-security-hsts/](https://www.invicti.com/learn/http-strict-transport-security-hsts/)


## Example Attacks

- A virtual appliance or software package deployed with default login credentials
- Directory listing not disabled on the server. Attackers can discover they can list directories, then they can download code, reverse engineer it, and develop targeted exploits.
- Detailed error messages (i.e. stack traces) left enabled
- Cloud-based services having default sharing permissions left publicly accessible


## Code Examples

Configure security headers in Next.js

The following code is copied from this [article from LogRocket](https://blog.logrocket.com/using-next-js-security-headers/)
- Ref: [https://blog.logrocket.com/using-next-js-security-headers/](https://blog.logrocket.com/using-next-js-security-headers/)

File: `next.config.js`

```javascript
const nextConfig = {
  reactStrictMode: true,
  swcMinify: true,  
  // Adding policies:
  async headers() {
    return [
        {
          source: '/(.*)',
          headers: [
            {
              key: 'X-Frame-Options',
              value: 'DENY',
            },
            {
              key: 'Content-Security-Policy',
              value:
                "default-src 'self' 'http://blog.logrocket.com'; image-src 'https://unsplash.com'; script-src 'self' https://www.google-analytics.com; font-src 'self' 'https://fonts.googleapis.com'",
            },
            {
              key: 'X-Content-Type-Options',
              value: 'nosniff',
            },
            {
              key: 'Permissions-Policy',
              value: "camera=(); battery=(self); geolocation=(); microphone=('https://a-domain.com')",
            },
            {
              key: 'Referrer-Policy',
              value: 'origin-when-cross-origin',
            },
          ],
        },
      ];
  },   
}

module.exports = nextConfig
```
