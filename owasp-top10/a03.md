## \# 3 - Injection

"Injection" doesn't have to mean any one type of code injection. It could
pertain to **any instance of unintended side-effects produced from 
executing code received from unwanted user input**. This primarily 
happens by not validing external data input.

A few types of injection:

- SQL injection
- XSS (DOM-based, reflected, or stored)
- external control of file name/path
- OS command injection

### DOM-based

#### Example Code

A DOM-based XSS attack could look like this. Where we perform an action
based on user input without validating the input. However, the 
injection's side effects take place _entirely client-side_.

```javascript
var userInput = "asdf" // from HTML element, no validation

var el = document.getElementById('some-paragraph');
el.innerHTML(userInput);
```

### Reflected XSS

A common way to see this is unvalidated input from query parameters in a 
URL.

#### Example

We have this URL for our page
```bash
sample URL => https://somewebsite.com?search=funinput
```
And we want to use the query parameters in some type of processing. (i.e.
submitting the term to a custom search function)
```js
// Get URL as string, split on '?', index 1 holds query params
var params = window.location.href.split('?')[1];

// NOTE: param NOT validated
var term = params.split('=')[1];
var data = fancySearchAPI(term)
```
And then further on the page, we're blindly displaying the results.
```html
<script>
    var el = document.getElementById('display');
    el.innerHTML(data)
</script>

<div id="display"></div>
```

If a malicious user submits the following, they might be able to start 
sniffing out `localStorage`, cookies, or anything else that is loaded
in the browser.

```bash
https://somewebsite.com?search=localStorage.getItem('secret')
```

### Stored XSS

What are HTTPOnly cookies? (or cookies without JavaScript access)

injection attacks?
